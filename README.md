# hi, i'm jess :3c

platform engineer who likes building things that are interesting and maybe a little cursed

## what i'm into
- systems programming (rust, go)
- distributed systems & data infrastructure
- breaking things to understand how they work

## what goes here
- experiments with language internals
- oss contributions
- projects that explore the boundaries of what's possible
- things that technically work (emphasis on technically)

most projects here are for learning and exploration. if something looks weird, that's intentional

*currently procrastinating something by being here*
